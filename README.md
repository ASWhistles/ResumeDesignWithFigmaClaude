# ResumeDesignWithFigmaClaude
This project was assigned in our Innovative Technologies class at the University of Colorado CMCI Department
The brief was to sketch out and create 3 different Figma templates for our resume
Then pull the Figma template into Claude.ai to create a website, including code

I have a lot to learn about coding and GitHub!
